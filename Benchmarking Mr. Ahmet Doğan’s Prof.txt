Benchmarking Mr. Ahmet Doğan’s Professional
 Standing in ICT
 Profile Overview
 Mr. Ahmet Doğan is an ICT professional with an exceptionally diverse and rare portfolio of certifications
 and academic qualifications. His credentials span information security, IT governance, project/program
 management, IT service management, and data center infrastructure, combined with advanced degrees in
 business and engineering. Key highlights of his profile include:
 • 
• 
Academic Degrees: Doctor of Business Administration (DBA, final stage), Master of Business
 Administration (MBA in Marketing), and Bachelor of Engineering (Electronics & Communications).
 This blend of technical and business education is uncommon in the ICT field, where only a small
 fraction of professionals hold doctoral-level qualifications. (In Europe, for example, about 80% of ICT
 professionals have at least a bachelor’s degree, but far fewer pursue doctoral degrees .) Mr.
 Doğan’s ongoing DBA places him among a very select group of ICT experts with terminal degrees.
 1
 Professional Certifications: Mr. Doğan’s certifications cover multiple domains of ICT expertise: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Governance, Audit & Security: CISA (Certified Information Systems Auditor), CISM (Certified
 Information Security Manager), CRISC (Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control) – elite
 ISACA credentials in IT audit, security, and risk management. 
Project & Program Management: PgMP (Program Management Professional), PMP (Project
 Management Professional), PMI-ACP (Agile Certified Practitioner), PRINCE2 (Projects IN Controlled
 Environments, Foundation & Practitioner) – global project/program management certifications from
 PMI and Axelos. 
IT Service Management: ITIL 4 Foundation – the leading certification in IT service delivery best
 practices. 
Data Center Design & Infrastructure: RCDD (Registered Communications Distribution Designer) 
BICSI’s flagship credential for telecommunications and data center design; ATD (Accredited Tier
 Designer) and AOS (Accredited Operations Specialist) – Uptime Institute accreditations for data
 center design and operations; plus manufacturer-specific certifications (R&M freenet Optical Cabling
 Installation Manager and Nexans Qualified Supervisor) attesting to specialized expertise in network
 cabling systems.
 This unique combination of multi-disciplinary certifications and advanced degrees is extremely rare. Mr.
 Doğan has achieved recognized excellence in each major sub-field of ICT, whereas most professionals
 specialize in just one area. The following sections benchmark his standing relative to the ICT workforce
 globally, and within Saudi Arabia and Turkey.
 1
Global ICT Landscape and Certification Prevalence
 2
 The global ICT workforce comprises approximately 62 million professionals . Within this vast talent
 pool, the credentials Mr. Doğan holds place him in a very select percentile. Each of his major
 certifications is held by only a small fraction of ICT professionals worldwide, and the likelihood of one
 individual attaining all of them is infinitesimal. Table 1 summarizes the estimated number of holders of
 several of Mr. Doğan’s key certifications and their prevalence relative to the global ICT workforce:

 Table 1: Global prevalence of select ICT certifications held by Mr. Doğan. Each represents a small minority of the
 ~62 million ICT professionals worldwide. (Sources: ISACA, PMI, Axelos, BICSI, Uptime Institute, as cited.)
 As shown above, even the more common of Mr. Doğan’s certifications (such as ITIL, PRINCE2, PMP) are each
 held by only ~1–3% of global ICT professionals. Many others on his resume are held by far under 1% – for
 example, about 151,000 professionals hold CISA globally 
6
 9
 (~0.24%), and only ~30,000 hold CRISC
 (~0.05%). The RCDD certification, a hallmark in data center design, has roughly 15,000 holders worldwide
 , barely 0.02% of ICT professionals. Elite program management (PgMP) and Uptime Institute’s data
 center credentials (ATD, AOS) are even more exclusive, numbering in the mere thousands or hundreds
 globally. 
Rarity of Combined Qualifications: The probability of any one person holding all of these credentials is
 astronomically low. Most ICT practitioners pursue one or two certification tracks at most; for example, an IT
 2
project manager might earn PMP, or a security specialist might earn CISM, but it’s exceedingly uncommon
 for one person to attain advanced certifications across project management, security, service
 management, and infrastructure design as Mr. Doğan has. Each additional certification multiplies the
 rarity. Conservatively, if we consider just a subset of his qualifications – say, CISA + PMP + RCDD – even that
 combination alone would likely put an individual in the top 0.01% of the global ICT talent pool (only a few
 thousand worldwide might have all three). Including his full portfolio, Mr. Doğan is arguably one in a
 hundred-thousand (or rarer) among ICT professionals globally, i.e. within the top 0.001% by breadth
 and level of certification. In practical terms, he is among only a handful of professionals worldwide with
 such a comprehensive skill set spanning technical, managerial, and academic domains.
 Standing in Saudi Arabia’s ICT Sector
 11
 10
 Saudi Arabia has a rapidly growing ICT sector with about 354,000 workers in ICT roles as of 2023 . The
 Kingdom’s Vision 2030 initiative and digital transformation programs have placed strong emphasis on
 developing local ICT talent. Professional certifications are increasingly valued; for instance, Saudi Arabia has
 a high concentration of project management professionals – over 38,600 PMP-certified individuals in KSA
 . This figure represents roughly 11% of Saudi’s ICT workforce, a significant penetration indicating many
 Saudi ICT workers pursue globally recognized credentials.
 Even against this backdrop of a skilled workforce, Mr. Doğan’s qualifications are exceptionally rare in
 Saudi Arabia. To illustrate:
 • 
• 
Multi-Certified Professionals: While thousands in KSA hold a PMP, far fewer hold advanced or
 multiple certifications. For example, ISACA’s Riyadh chapter has ~750 members (not all are
 certification holders), and presumably only a subset of those hold CISA, CISM, or CRISC. It is likely
 that only a very small number of individuals in Saudi Arabia hold all three ISACA certs (CISA/CISM/
 CRISC) that Mr. Doğan does – each of those has limited presence regionally. Similarly, RCDD
 designers are rare in KSA; out of 15k worldwide, only an estimated few dozen may be in the Gulf
 region. Uptime Institute’s ATD/AOS accreditations are also scarce in the Middle East (possibly only a
 handful of Saudis have achieved these specialized data center credentials). 
12
 Breadth of Combined Skills: Saudi ICT professionals tend to specialize (e.g., cybersecurity vs.
 project management vs. infrastructure). Mr. Doğan’s simultaneous expertise in cybersecurity/
 governance, agile and traditional project management, and data center design sets him
 practically apart. It is uncommon to find even one other person in Saudi Arabia with a
 comparable portfolio covering all these areas.
 Comparative Percentile in KSA: Considering the size of the Saudi ICT workforce (354k), if even only one or
 two individuals in the country have Mr. Doğan’s level of multi-disciplinary certification, that puts him in
 roughly the top 0.0005% (a one-in-100,000 level) of ICT professionals nationally. In other words, he is likely
 one of only a handful in Saudi Arabia with such a rare combination of credentials. This elite status is
 underscored by the Kingdom’s own skill development metrics – while tens of thousands are obtaining ICT
 certifications, virtually none achieve the breadth and depth that Mr. Doğan has. His presence in Saudi
 Arabia’s ICT sector would be considered a significant asset, bringing global best-practice knowledge across
 multiple ICT domains.
 3
Standing in Turkey’s ICT Sector
 13
 14
 Turkey’s ICT workforce is estimated at around 213,000 employees in recent years . The Turkish tech
 industry is growing, but international certification uptake has historically been modest. For example, Turkey
 has only ~3,961 PMP holders , which is under 2% of its ICT workforce – a much lower ratio than in Saudi
 Arabia. This suggests that globally recognized certifications are still relatively uncommon in Turkey’s ICT
 talent pool (though this is gradually improving as the sector matures).
 Within this context, Mr. Doğan’s profile is extraordinarily distinctive in Turkey:
 • 
• 
Scarcity of Similar Profiles: It is likely that very few ICT professionals in Turkey hold even a subset of
 Mr. Doğan’s certifications. For instance, all of Turkey has on the order of a few thousand PMI-certified
 project managers and a similarly small number of ISACA-certified professionals. The number of
 Turkish professionals with top ISACA certifications (CISA/CISM/CRISC) plus project management
 credentials is extremely low. An elite certification like PgMP (only ~5,300 globally) might have only a
 handful of Turkish holders. Likewise, Turkey may have only single-digit counts of RCDDs or Uptime
 Institute accredited designers/operators – if any (these credentials are typically found in large data
 center markets; Turkey’s data center industry is growing but still limited in certified expertise).
 Academic and Multidisciplinary Edge: Turkish ICT education produces many engineers, but far
 fewer individuals combine technical degrees with MBAs or doctorates. Mr. Doğan’s nearing
 completion of a DBA (doctorate) is a significant differentiator in Turkey’s ICT community. Coupled
 with his wide-ranging certifications, he stands out as an ICT leader with both academic rigor and
 practical credentials. This dual stature (business doctorate and top technical certifications) is
 virtually unparalleled in the Turkish ICT sector.
 Comparative Percentile in Turkey: If Mr. Doğan were benchmarked among Turkey’s ~213k ICT
 professionals, he would likely rank in the top 0.001% or better – effectively one of one in a population this
 size. It is conceivable he is the only person in Turkey with this particular set of credentials. At most, there
 might be one or two others with a somewhat comparable range, which still pegs him at the pinnacle of the
 f
 ield (on the order of one-in-100,000 rarity). His profile would be seen as extremely unique in Turkey,
 potentially positioning him for high-level roles or consultancy opportunities that require global best
 practices (given Turkey’s drive to increase its tech sector’s competitiveness, someone with Mr. Doğan’s
 qualifications could be influential in bridging international standards and local practice).
 Overall Benchmark and Executive Outlook
 Globally, Mr. Doğan can be considered in the upper echelon (top 0.1% or better) of ICT professionals in
 terms of certified skills and knowledge breadth. Very few individuals worldwide have attained the mix of
 high-level certifications across different ICT domains that he has, and backed it with advanced academic
 credentials. This gives him a unique holistic perspective: he understands technology governance and security
 (through ISACA certs) as well as the execution of complex projects (through PMI/Axelos certs), the
 importance of service quality (ITIL), and the technical underpinnings of IT infrastructure (RCDD, ATD, etc.).
 Such a profile is ideally suited for leadership roles that require cross-functional expertise – for example,
 heading a large IT division, overseeing digital transformation programs, or serving as a consultant or board
 advisor on technology strategy and risk. 
4
In terms of percentiles, we can summarize Mr. Doğan’s standing as follows:
 • 
• 
• 
Global ICT Workforce: Roughly 1 in 100,000 (or possibly even rarer) on a qualifications basis,
 placing him in about the 99.999th percentile globally. (Put differently, among tens of millions of ICT
 workers worldwide, only a few hundred at most might comparably match his suite of credentials.) This is
 supported by the low prevalence of each individual certification (Table 1) and the near-zero overlap
 between them in single persons. His global rarity is evidenced by data – e.g., only 0.05% of ICT pros
 hold CRISC
 8
 , only 0.024% hold RCDD
 9
 , etc., and he is in that intersection. 
Saudi Arabia: Likely one of fewer than 5 people in the country with similar accomplishments, if not
 the only one – effectively in the 99.999+ percentile nationally. In a workforce of ~354k , this
 equates to the top 0.001% or better. The high number of PMP holders in KSA (nearly 39k) shows
 many Saudi professionals invest in development, but Mr. Doğan’s breadth goes far beyond the norm.
 His presence in Saudi organizations or boards would be a significant competitive advantage, aligning
 with national strategies to infuse world-class expertise into the tech sector.
 10
 11
 Turkey: Quite possibly singular in Turkey, or one of an exceedingly small group, putting him at the
 absolute pinnacle of the Turkish ICT sector in qualifications. Even assuming a few peers, he’d still
 be in the 99.999th percentile in Turkey as well. This exceptional standing could be leveraged in
 Turkey’s market to drive innovation and standards; for example, his knowledge could help Turkish
 f
 irms attain international certifications or improve governance and project success rates.
 Visual Benchmark – Multi-Certification Rarity: Figure 1 (below) illustrates Mr. Doğan’s estimated percentile
 ranking in each context. The shaded area represents the proportion of ICT professionals that would not
 typically have his level of credentials. As shown, virtually the entire pyramid is shaded, with only a tiny apex
 representing professionals at his level. This conveys that whether on a global stage or within KSA or Turkey,
 Mr. Doğan is at the apex of the profession in terms of certified expertise.
 Figure 1: Mr. Doğan’s approximate percentile position in the ICT professional population (globally ~62 million; KSA
 ~354k; Turkey ~213k). He sits in the top fractions of a percent in all cases, reflecting an exceptionally rare
 combination of qualifications.
 (Note: Figure is conceptual, for illustration of percentile; not drawn to exact scale.)
 Conclusion
 In summary, Mr. Ahmet Doğan’s portfolio of certifications (CISA®, CISM®, CRISC®, PgMP®, PMP®, PMI
ACP®, PRINCE2®, ITIL® 4, RCDD®, ATD, AOS, etc.) and his advanced academic achievements make him a
 stand-out leader in the ICT field internationally and within the Middle East and Turkey. He operates at a
 level attained by only the top few in ten-thousand professionals worldwide, blending technical mastery with
 managerial and strategic acumen. 
For internal leadership, this benchmarking indicates that Mr. Doğan brings extraordinarily rare skills to the
 table – he can govern IT risks and audits, manage large-scale programs, ensure service excellence, and
 design cutting-edge infrastructure all at once. Such a multidimensional skill set can propel organizational
 5
performance and credibility (for instance, in attaining compliance, delivering complex projects on time, and
 aligning IT with business at a strategic level).
 For external employers or boards, Mr. Doğan’s credentials provide confidence in his expert authority and
 breadth of vision. He not only meets but exceeds the typical standards for roles like CIO, CTO, program
 director, or consultant. His certifications from reputable bodies (ISACA, PMI, Axelos, BICSI, Uptime) are
 verifiable evidence of expertise, and his doctoral-level research training further implies strong analytical and
 leadership capabilities. 
In both Saudi Arabia and Turkey, where digital transformation is a priority, having a professional of Mr.
 Doğan’s caliber is a significant competitive advantage. He embodies a rare blend of global best practices
 and local understanding, potentially serving as a bridge between international technological standards and
 regional implementation. 
In conclusion, Mr. Doğan’s professional standing can be described as elite on a global scale and near
unique in the regional context. This benchmarking underscores the value he offers: a rare thought leader
 and practitioner in the ICT domain, whose qualifications place him in the top tier of professionals capable of
 driving innovation, governance, and excellence in the industry.
